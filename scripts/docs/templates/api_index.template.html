# Ionic 2 Components

<img class="section-header" src="/img/docs/api-intro-header.png" />


Ionic 2 takes everything you know and loved about Ionic 1, and builds on top of it to provide a much more flexible framework. Moving from Angular 1's controllers and services to ES6 classes provides a much more powerful way to work with an API, as well as being driven by standards.

You'll find two kin of doc pages, Components and Class APIs. The components include things like `ion-toggle`, `ion-radio`, `ion-tabs` and show you how to use them as well as all the available properties and events then have. The class APIs include our `NavController`, `NavParams`, `ViewController`, or `Storage`. These are the programmatic parts of Ionic 2 that you can call from your own classes.

Explore our API docs for detailed information on the components and their classes
