# Ionic 2 API Docs

<img class="section-header" src="/img/docs/api-intro-header.png" />


Ionic 2 takes everything you know and loved about Ionic 1, and builds on top of it to provide a much more flexible framework.

In the API docs, you'll find two kinds of doc pages: Component and Service APIs.

The Component docs include things like `ion-toggle`, `ion-radio`, `ion-tabs` and show you how to use them, as well as all of their available properties and events.

The Service APIs include `NavController`, `NavParams`, `Config` or `Platform`. These are Services provided by Ionic 2 that can be injected into your classes.
