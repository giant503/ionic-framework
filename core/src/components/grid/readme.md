# ion-grid


The grid is a powerful mobile-first flexbox system for building custom layouts.

It is composed of three units â€” a grid, [row(s)](../Row) and [column(s)]((../Col)). Columns will expand to fill the row, and will resize to fit additional columns. It is based on a 12 column layout with different breakpoints based on the screen size. The number of columns can be customized using CSS.

See [Grid Layout](/docs/layout/grid) for more information.
