# ion-loading

An overlay that can be used to indicate activity while blocking user interaction. The loading indicator appears on top of the app's content, and can be dismissed by the app to resume user interaction with the app. It includes an optional backdrop, which can be disabled by setting `showBackdrop: false` upon creation.


### Creating

Loading indicators can be created using a [Loading Controller](../../loading-controller/LoadingController). They can be customized by passing loading options in the loading controller's create method. The spinner name should be passed in the `spinner` property, and any optional HTML can be passed in the `content` property. If a value is not passed to `spinner` the loading indicator will use the spinner specified by the platform.


### Dismissing

The loading indicator can be dismissed automatically after a specific amount of time by passing the number of milliseconds to display it in the `duration` of the loading options. By default the loading indicator will show even during page changes, but this can be disabled by setting `dismissOnPageChange` to `true`. To dismiss the loading indicator after creation, call the `dismiss()` method on the loading instance. The `onDidDismiss` function can be called to perform an action after the loading indicator is dismissed.
