Columns are cellular components of the [grid](../Grid) system and go inside of a [row](../Row).
They will expand to fill their row. All content within a grid should go inside of a column.

See [Grid Layout](/docs/layout/grid) for more information.


## Column attributes

By default, columns will stretch to fill the entire height of the row.
There are several attributes that can be added to a column to customize this behavior.

| Property              | Description                                                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| align-self-start      | Adds `align-self: flex-start`. The column will be vertically aligned at the top.                            |
| align-self-center     | Adds `align-self: center`. The column will be vertically aligned in the center.                             |
| align-self-end        | Adds `align-self: flex-end`. The column will be vertically aligned at the bottom.                           |
| align-self-stretch    | Adds `align-self: stretch`. The column will be stretched to take up the entire height of the row.           |
| align-self-baseline   | Adds `align-self: baseline`. The column will be vertically aligned at its baseline.                         |
