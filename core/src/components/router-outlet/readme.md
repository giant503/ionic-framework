# ion-router-outlet

RouterOutlet is a component used in routing within an Angular app. RouterOutlet behaves the same way as Angular's built-in RouterOutlet component, but contains the logic needed for animating views in and out.


> Note: this is only meant for Angular projects. For vanilla JavaScript, use `ion-router` and `ion-route` instead.

While RouterOutlet has methods for navigating around, it's recommended to use the navigation methods in Angular's router.
