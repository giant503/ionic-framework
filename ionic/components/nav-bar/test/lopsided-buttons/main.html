      A long time ago, in a galaxy far,<br>
      far away....<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a period of civil war.<br>
      Rebel spaceships, striking<br>
      from a hidden base, have won<br>
      their first victory against<br>
      the evil Galactic Empire.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      During the battle, rebel<br>
      spies managed to steal secret<br>
      plans to the Empire's<br>
      ultimate weapon, the DEATH<br>
      STAR, an armored space<br>
      station with enough power to<br>
      destroy an entire planet.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
      Pursued by the Empire's<br>
      sinister agents, Princess<br>
      Leia races home aboard her<br>
      starship, custodian of the<br>
      stolen plans that can save<br>
      her people and restore<br>
      freedom to the galaxy....<br>
