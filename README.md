#### Test it out!

- Run `gulp watch` to build, serve, and watch Ionic & playground

#### Problems already

- If we have a `.spec.js` file as a sibling of a js file, 
  System will make that an export and ignore the `.js` file.  
  There's probably a setting in System.js somewhere to fix this.

#### Build

- JSCS
- JSHint (or TypeScript variant)
