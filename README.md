#### Building & Running

- `gulp watch`
- `httpster`
- `open http://localhost:9000/e2e/aside/basic/index.html`
- Follow the structure found in src/components/aside/examples/basic
  to create more examples.
  * The biggest thing to remember: your app has to import its dependencies with the `app/` prefix.
    For example `import {Apple} from 'apple';` would import apple.js in your example app.


#### Update Angular

    ./scripts/build/update-angular.sh
