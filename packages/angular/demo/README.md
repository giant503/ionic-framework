# Demo

The purpose of this application is to provide an Angular CLI application where Ionic Core components can be tested in a simple manner. This application allows the developer to experiment with interactions between Angular and Ionic in an easy and safe manner.

## Getting started

From this directory:

- `npm i`
- `npm start` - to serve the application
- `npm test` - to run the unit tests
- `npm run e2e` - to run the end to end tests

See the `package.json` file for a complete list of script. The above are just the most common.

## Running the Angular CLI

This application installs the Angular CLI locally so you do not need to have it installed globally. You can use `npm` to run any of the `ng` commands. For example:

- `npm run ng build -- --prod` - run a production build
- `npm run ng g component my-cool-thing`
